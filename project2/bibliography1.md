## Fractality and Self-Organized Criticality of Wars

Roberts, D. C., & Turcotte, D. L. (1998). Fractality and self-organized criticality of wars. _Fractals_, 6(04), 351-357.

Building on LF Richardson's paper _Frequency of occurrence of wars and other fatal quarrels_, Roberts and Turcotte find that the power-law distribution applies to wars and suggest that they are an example of self-organized criticality. They begin by observing the power-law rule with regards to the number of battle deaths in a war. In order to argue for battles exhibiting self-organized criticality they first discuss the forest-fire model in depth and its comparison to wildfire data. They then discuss how wildfires and wars have similar "sparks" and life cycles.
