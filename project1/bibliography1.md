Strano et al analyze a portion of the Italian road network north of Milan. They
observe that urbanization is shaped by high-centrality roads and the formation of cell shapes. They confirm that the distribution of the cell areas is a power law and observe how it changes over time. They suggest that further investigation into road networks in different geographic and economic areas will provide further support for a more general model of the urbanization process.
