Girvan and Newman examine community structure in networks, where nodes within a network form smaller connected groups. They propose a method for detecting these communities, and test it with computer-generated and real-world graphs with known and unknown community structure. They find that their new method provide informative and reasonable communities in the examined networks, including food networks, football matches, and collaboration networks. They propose is to further generalize the method and improve its efficiency with larger networks.
