Griffith et al. explored the organization of the darkweb, creating a graph of domains with directed edges between them representing the number of links to from one domain to another. They found that the darkweb is far less connected than the World Wide Web, with one main hub and various "isolated dark silos". They did not find conclusive evidence of a powerlaw distribution. The paper is mainly a report on the structure of the dark web, and offers little to explain its structure other than the users being "simply less social". There is potential for further analysis of the darkweb and comparisons to the World Wide Web - this study used a third party service (scrapinghub.com) for crawling over a period of five months, so projects utilizing already crawled data may be better suited for this course.
